It crept into the minds of those who lived within the fallen kingdoms, twisting their thoughts until they lost themselves entirely, becoming monstrous reflections of their former selves.\n\nNo scholar, priest, or sorcerer could ever uncover the origin of this silence. The ancient libraries burned, the oracle stones cracked, and even the gods’ whispers faded from the temples. Only fragments of old prophecies remain — warnings that the silence was never meant to end.\n\nNow, generations later, a band of explorers from distant realms sets out to trace its source. Among them: a war-scarred knight seeking redemption, a scholar of forbidden magic, a healer who survived the silence once before, and a hunter who has seen its creatures up close. Each bears a personal scar — and a secret reason to uncover the truth.\n\nTheir journey leads them beyond ruined fortresses and into a place untouched by time — a forgotten relic buried in the heart of the dead lands. But what they find there is not the echo of a lost age. It is a living design, one that proves the silence was never abandoned.\n\nSomeone — or something — is still guarding it.\nAnd perhaps, the silence isn’t sleeping at all… it’s calling them home.",

Every bell toll, every market trade, every whispered prayer happens in eerie unison. To the untrained eye, it looks like harmony. To those who listen closely, it feels like a single thought breathing through a hundred mouths.\n\nThe town is ruled not by crown or council, but by a *Hivemind* — a vast psychic network binding every villager into one will. No crime. No lies. No freedom. Outsiders who stay too long begin to dream in the town’s voice, until even their heartbeat falls in step with the rest.\n\nFar beyond the valley, a distant kingdom grows desperate. The Hivemind holds an ancient relic — a core of crystal thought said to amplify its control. If stolen, it could break the connection and free the town. Or, if disturbed, it could awaken something far worse.\n\nSo a small band of envoys is sent under moonlight: spies, thieves, and soldiers disguised as pilgrims. Their task is clear — retrieve the relic without alerting the Hivemind. But in Veyra’s Rest, *every whisper is heard*, *every heartbeat is shared*, and *every lie echoes in a thousand minds*.\n\nThe deeper they move into the town’s pulse, the more their own thoughts begin to blur. Who among them is still free — and who has already been claimed?\n\nBecause in Veyra’s Rest, silence isn’t safety.\nIt’s the sound of something thinking.",

These shared dreams have revealed to her the presence of a powerful relic within the Crystal Chamber, believed to amplify the Hivemind's grasp.

From them, Elara inherited a dual legacy of craftsmanship and mysticism, nurturing her unique talents.

This encounter ignited her desire to understand the intertwined fates of her lineage and the Hivemind's secrets. With the burden of these revelations and her family’s legacy, she joined the envoys to Veyra’s Rest, driven by a quest to unravel the enigma of the relic and prevent the shroud of the Hivemind from consuming her identity and the freedom of the townsfolk.",
