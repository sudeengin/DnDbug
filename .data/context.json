It crept into the minds of those who lived within the fallen kingdoms, twisting their thoughts until they lost themselves entirely, becoming monstrous reflections of their former selves.\n\nNo scholar, priest, or sorcerer could ever uncover the origin of this silence. The ancient libraries burned, the oracle stones cracked, and even the gods’ whispers faded from the temples. Only fragments of old prophecies remain — warnings that the silence was never meant to end.\n\nNow, generations later, a band of explorers from distant realms sets out to trace its source. Among them: a war-scarred knight seeking redemption, a scholar of forbidden magic, a healer who survived the silence once before, and a hunter who has seen its creatures up close. Each bears a personal scar — and a secret reason to uncover the truth.\n\nTheir journey leads them beyond ruined fortresses and into a place untouched by time — a forgotten relic buried in the heart of the dead lands. But what they find there is not the echo of a lost age. It is a living design, one that proves the silence was never abandoned.\n\nSomeone — or something — is still guarding it.\nAnd perhaps, the silence isn’t sleeping at all… it’s calling them home.",
