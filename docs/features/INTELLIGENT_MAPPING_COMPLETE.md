- Story context: religious upbringing, divine calling, scholarly pursuits

#### **Criminal Detection**
- Keywords: thief, rogue, criminal, steal, outlaw, bandit, smuggler, assassin
- Role patterns: thief, rogue, merchant, trader, guild member
- Story context: criminal past, underground connections, illicit activities

#### **Folk Hero Detection**
- Keywords: hero, champion, defender, protector, guardian, savior
- Context: village, common, peasant, farmer, noble, lord, soldier, warrior, knight
- Story context: protecting others, rising from humble origins, military service

### 3. **Visual Preview System**

## 🔍 Mapping Examples

### Example 1: Religious Character
```
Story Character: "Elven Priest of Light"
→ Suggested Race: Elf
→ Suggested Background: Acolyte
Reason: "priest" + "elven" + religious context
```

### Example 2: Criminal Character
```
Story Character: "Human Thief and Smuggler"
→ Suggested Race: Human
→ Suggested Background: Criminal
Reason: "thief" + "smuggler" + criminal context
```

### Example 3: Heroic Character
```
Story Character: "Dwarven Village Defender"
→ Suggested Race: Dwarf
→ Suggested Background: Folk Hero
Reason: "defender" + "village" + protective context
```
