## Why Archived?

These scripts were one-time migration utilities that:
1. Scanned codebase for `console.log` statements
2. Replaced them with appropriate logger calls
3. Ensured consistent logging across the application

The migration has been **completed successfully**, so these scripts are kept here for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the migration process
- Similar future migrations (as templates)

**Do not run these scripts on the current codebase** - the migration is already complete.
